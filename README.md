# Vinyl Cards
Card display I created to work on my understanding of the pseudo elements *before* and *after*.

The *before* and *after* elements are specifically used to add styling to the product header and the "more info" link.
I added a hover effect to the cards which darkens the product image and displays the product specs over the product picture, making the specs easier to read.

The individual cards are contained within a flex-box container, making the design responsive.

The product details are hard coded, but could easily be converted for use with an API call.
